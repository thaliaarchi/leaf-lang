# Leaf: A tree-based Turing tarpit

A fast implementation of the Leaf esoteric programming language in Rust.

[Leaf](https://github.com/CRogers/leaf) is a programming language by Callum
Rogers, made for the PLT Games December 2012 competition [“Into the Tarpit”](https://web.archive.org/web/20140910193725/http://www.pltgames.com/competition/2012/12).
Its only data structure is a single binary tree and it provides operations to
manipulate it.
